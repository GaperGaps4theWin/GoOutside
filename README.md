# GoOutside
GoOutside design webpage
Anthony Gray and I (Jack Thibodeau) are working together to create an interactive webpage containg 
a store, updating feeds, a database containing details such as product descriptions images and inventory count.
The database will aslo have a user table with set permisions that will allow the website owner to do simple modifications to the page from any mobile

We will be using react with webpack and babel, along with some flask templating
